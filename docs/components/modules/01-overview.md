# Approach

The use of **{{ config.extra.components_name }}** represents a radical shift in frontend integration within Magento. Any modules not explicitly declared as compatible with this new format will be ignored, including their layouts, blocks, and any frontend-related configuration.

This approach eliminates the burden of legacy code and outdated practices associated with traditional themes like **Luma** and **Blank**, paving the way for cleaner, more modern, and efficient development.

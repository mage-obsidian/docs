# Approach

The use of **{{ config.extra.components_name }}** for themes represents a radical shift in how frontend themes are integrated into Magento. This approach completely removes support for legacy technologies such as LESS, Knockout, and RequireJS, embracing modern tools and practices.

Moreover, this new standard not only ensures a cleaner and more efficient foundation for theme development but also significantly enhances the developer experience. By simplifying and modernizing methodologies, **{{ config.extra.components_name }}** aims to attract new developers to the Magento ecosystem, offering a more intuitive and up-to-date environment aligned with current web development trends.
